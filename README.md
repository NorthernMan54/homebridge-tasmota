Homebridge Plugin for Tasmota Devices that leverage's the Home Assistant Auto Discovery Function to configure and add devices.  And remove the need to manually configure Tasmota devices with Homebridge.  So far this has been tested with Switches/Outlets, Dimmers/Light's and temperature sensors ymmv for other devices.

## Features

* Automatic discovery and configuration of supported Tasmota devices in Homebridge/Homekit.
* Cleanup and removal of disconnected devices after 24 hours.
* Support for these types of devices Outlets, Dimmers, Sensors and Lightbulbs with RGB and Colour Temperature.
* Graphing of historical sensor information using fakegato.  ( Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure and Current sensors ).

## Tasmota Device's Tested YMMV for other devices

* switch - WiOn (17) Outlet Module
* light - Tuya Dimmer (54) Dimmer Switch
* sensor - Generic (18) with a bme280 connected
* relay - ESP with multiple relays connected.
* Door contact sensors
* Arilux LC06 - Light with Dimmer and Colour Temperature capabilities
* [Franken sensor](docs/IMG_5365.jpg) - 2 DHT22 Temperature / Humidity Sensors, 2 BME280 Temperature / Humidity / Air Pressure Sensors ( pressure is not supported ) and a BH1750 Luminance.  In [Tasmota](docs/IMG_5367.png) and in [HomeKit](docs/IMG_5368.png).
* ws2812 addressable RGB led light strip
* RGB LED Light Strip
* Support for [AZ-7798 CO2 Monitor](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/AZ-7798) - Tks Jeroen Vermeulen
* PIR Motion sensor ( requires minor configuration )
* Wipro Next 20W Smart LED Batten (White) Light

* WemosDB - Doorbell device

## Tasmota Devices that do not work or have issues

For autodiscovery to work and the proper device to be created in Homebridge the device needs to include its 'device_class' as part of the discovery message.  Majority of the basic sensor types that use GPIO pins do not include this type of information, but other sensors that use I2C do.  An easy way to quickly determine if the Tasmota knows what type of device it is, is if the Tasmota page knows the type of sensor information.  Like temperature.

## Installation / Configuration

For installation and configuration of the plugin please use the homebridge UI/console.

### Tasmota Device Config

1. Enable Home Assistant Auto Discovery from the console

```
SetOption19 1
```

* Please note that this setting will change the topics of your Tasmota device and a couple of other settings and will break existing integrations.  Please see here [under setOption19](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#setoption19).

2. MQTT Topic Configuration

I found that some of my devices were not using a unique Topic for devices and I needed to update the configuration to

**Topic:** tasmota_%06X

This showed up when looking at MQTT messages and I was seeing them with this Topic.

```
sonoff/tele/STATE

or

tasmota/tele/STATE
```

## Device Removal or Device Configuration Reset

If Home Assistant Auto Discovery for a device is disabled, the accessory will be removed from homekit.  Useful for cleaning up devices that have wacky configurations accidentally created while configuring your device.  

```
SetOption19 0
```

## Discovery Overrides

### Fan

If you override the tasmotaType with the value of `fan` a fan device will be created.  Tested with a Tuya Dimmer.  The first field `EF159D_LI_1` is the unique_id of the device.

```
"override": {
  "EF159D_LI_1": {
    "tasmotaType": "fan"
  }
}
```

## Technical Details

Under the covers this plugin leverages the Home Assistant Auto Discovery Function (setOption19) built into the Tasmota firmware and the [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) feature built into Home Assistant.  And uses the information provided by the Tasmota device to configure the HomeKit Accessory automatically without requiring within Homebridge.  

## Known issues

### Accessory Names Doubled

Accessory names are doubled with Tasmota version 8.1.3 to 8.4 - This is an issue with Tasmota firmware and is being tracked [here](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/8995).  As a workaround downgrade to Tasmota version 8.1

i.e. "Scanner Scanner"

### Phantom Devices or Services

As device discovery is leveraging Home Assistant MQTT Auto Discovery, it is using these retained messages on your MQTT server, and will create and recreate them based on these retained messages.  To eradicate these phantom devices the retained messages for the appropriate accessory / device need to removed from your MQTT server using a tool like MQTT Explorer.

The Home Assistant MQTT Auto Discovery messages live under the topic 'homeassistant/' and a device can have multiple messages that need to be removed depending on the number and type of services.  If you make a mistake and accidentally delete a message for an active device, rebooting the device or setting 'setoption19 1' will recreate messages.

If you change the configuration in Tasmota of an existing device, and the old characteristics are still visible, you will need to clean up the 'Home Assistant MQTT Auto Discovery' messages for the device then disconnect the device for the cleanup period.  You can temporarily change the cleanup period to 0.125 which is approx 10 minutes if your in a hurry.

### Frequency of sensor information updates

Frequency of data updates is controlled by the Tasmota device itself and not the plugin itself.  The plugin does not poll the device for status, but processes telemetry updates as they are received.  The plugin watches for telemetry updates on the tele/SENSOR topic ie 'tasmota-5042/tele/SENSOR'.

During initialization of the plugin, it sets the [teleperiod](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#TelePeriod) option to 300 seconds ( 5 minutes ).  This is done to force the device to refresh status immediately after plugin startup.  And then further updates are published every 5 minutes by the accessory.

To drive realtime updates of sensor value changes a rule would need to be created on the device to publish the new data on the appropriate tele/SENSOR topic for the device whenever a sensor changes value, something like this from the Tasmota rule cookbook.

https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Rules/#transmit-sensor-value-only-when-a-delta-is-reached

This is discussed in detail in this Tasmota issue https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/2567

This is a sample Tasmota rule for BH1750 Illuminance sensor to send updates with every value change.

```
Rule1 ON BH1750#Illuminance!=%var1% DO Backlog var1 %value%; teleperiod 300; ENDON
Rule1 1
```

As a side effect the rule resets the `teleperiod` to 300 seconds similar to restarting the plugin.
